# python-challenge

Option 1: PyBank

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset
The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period


Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future (your boss is going to give you more of these -- so your script has to work for the ones to come). In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.




Option 2: PyPoll

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.



Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future (i.e you have zero intentions of living in this hillbilly town -- so your script needs to work without massive re-writes). In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
